In the Second session of Ylabs Developer Bootcamp, I got task to make a Flutter app consisting at minimum of 4 widgets.
I made a realtime Weather App for my city, Bogor. This is my very first ever mobile application I made using Flutter.

The Widgets I use are listed below:
- Scaffold
- Collumn
- Padding
- Text
- Expanded
- ListView
- ListTile

And above all tasks given for us, I also learn about open source **API fetching** using Flutter for the realtime weather information. 

In the third session, I'm using **GetX for navigation and state management**. 

In the fourth session, I implement API fetching again with different approach than that has previously done in the second session task :).
I'm using API from:
http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline

And with the help of https://app.quicktype.io/, to make the models.

For the fifth and sixth (last session in Ylabs developer bootcamp) session, I'm using screenutils widget in order to make the application responsive in any screen size. I'm making a news list, and news content article from open source API.
