In the Second session of Ylabs Developer Bootcamp, I was told to make a Flutter app consisting at minimum of 4 widgets.
I made a realtime Weather App for my city, Bogor. This is my very first ever mobile application I made using Flutter.

The Widgets I use are listed below:
- Scaffold
- Collumn
- Padding
- Text
- Expanded
- ListView
- ListTile

And above all tasks given for us, I also learn about open source **API fetching** using Flutter for the realtime weather information. 

In the third session, I'm using **GetX for navigation and state management**. 

In the fourth session, I implement API fetching again with different approach than that has previously done in the second session task :).
I'm using API from:

And with the help of https://app.quicktype.io/, to make the models.
